### Thoughts about layout

* Was thinking a folder with completed code for each stage of the lesson. Possibly each stage could also have an extra challenge or two added to it for more advanced students/post event? 
    * /htmlStage
        - Completed code folder
        - Not sure about challenge
            - ? - maybe other tags to see how they appear? h1-h6 
    * /cssStage
        - Completed code folder
        - Challenges: Add a second image and get them to appear side by side
            - Hint: use their width, display and margin to show up next to each other
    * /jsStage
        - Completed code folder
        - Challenges: Add a button that changes the photo too another photo
            - Hint: use CSS style property `display: none` and the JS `.classList` .add or .remove
            - Try googling for a way to do this. If  you get stuck click on the reference below.
