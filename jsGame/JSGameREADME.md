# Tic-Tack-Toe game

## In this challenge you will create a tic-tack-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

*  The HTML and CSS files have been set up for you. You may change these, but their current form is what the solution is based on.

*  Remember: If you try out the different stages of the JavaScript files, but sure to link them correctly in your HTML document.

* The `jsGameSomeMoreHints.js` has each many of your functions created for you, but they lack what they're supposed to do. This is to give you a framework if you'd like without giving to much away  :) 

* Feel free to peek at the solution file if you need some direction. 

## Instructions:
- To play, open `index.html` in your browser. 
- Write your JavaScript inside of `jsGameFile1.js`
- Remember you have to refresh the page each time to see your changes. 
- Happy coding!


## The end goal: 
* A player can click on an empty 'square' and place their marker on it. 
* Turns should alternate between 'X' and 'O'
* If a player clicks on a square that is occupied, they should be `alerted` to make a move in a different space
* At the end of each turn, the game should check to see if a player won. Be sure to let them know who won :)
