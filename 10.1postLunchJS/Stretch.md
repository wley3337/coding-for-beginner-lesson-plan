# JavaScript stretch activities

## Data Types

### Arrays
* Create a new array from an existing set of arrays.
    - Learn.co lesson: BootcampPrep V2 → Javascript Fundamentals → Data Structures → JavaScript Arrays
    * Take an array of names ["Charlotte", "Bob"] or whatever names you would like and iterate through them 
    * Create a `<p></p>` with each of the names ( `<p>Charlotte</p>` ) 
    * Add those `<p></p>` new tags to a new array
* Supper challenge: 
    * Take that array and append it to the DOM
    * It can be in a list ( `<ul> <li>NAME HERE</li> </ul>`) or as the `<p></p>` tags

### Objects
* Create a new object for someone you know:
    - Learn.co BootcampPrep V2 → Javascript Fundamentals → Data Structures → JavaScript Objects 
    * They should have a name
    * age
    * Favorite thing to do
    * How would you then put this on the DOM for a user profile page? 
* Deeper learning

## Functions
- Learn.co BootcampPrep V2  → Javascript Fundamentals → Functions and Scope → Intro to Functions
* Conditional Logic(if, else)
    - Learn.co BootcampPrep V2 → Javascript Fundamentals → Programming JS in The IDE→ Conditional Statements
*  Helper Functions
    - Learn.co BootcampPrep V2 → JavaScript Fundamentals → The DOM → Hide and SeekLab
    * How can we take our onClick function and break it up into smaller functions so that it's easier to follow and also easier to reuse 
        * Hint: What if we wanted to grab the like information for other parts of our page? 
* Supper Challenge: 
    * Make a `fetch` call to an `API` 
        -[MDN documentation on fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
        * Then display some of that information to the screen.
            - Two free APIs are the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) and the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Events
   * Add an 'onHover' event that changes a CSS property on the object. 
        * this is a fun thing to add to a button or other object on the DOM that you want to highlight when a user can perform an action. 

   * Supper Deep Dive:
        * [Konami Code](https://mentalfloss.com/article/56401/23-places-where-konami-code-lives) event listener to the window object and have it do something fun.
