## Data Types

### Arrays
* Create a new array from an existing set of arrays.
    - Learn.co lesson: BootcampPrep V2 → Javascript Fundamentals → Data Structures → JavaScript Arrays
    * Take an array of names `["Charlotte", "Bob"]` or whatever names you would like and iterate through them 
    * Create a `<p></p>` with each of the names ( `<p>Charlotte</p>` ) 
    * Add those `<p></p>` new tags to a new array
* Super challenge: 
    * Take that array and append each of it's elements to the DOM
    * It can be in a list ( `<ul> <li>NAME HERE</li> </ul>`) or as the `<p></p>` tags

### Objects
