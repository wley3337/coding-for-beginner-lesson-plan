// This is where you write all of you JavaScript code. 

// <--- this two forward slashes let you write comments in your code. 
// The computer will skip over these lines. 
//It's a great way to leave notes for yourself!

// Step one is to link this file to our HTML document. 
// This is similar to adding our CSS files except that the file reference 
// goes inside of <script> </script> tags


//Declare three variables
// the order is this:
// keyWord variableName = valueOfOurVariable 


var once = "Upon a time..." //<-- var is an older way to write variable declarations and you will see it in some code examples. 

let twoBe = "The change you want to see in the world" //<-- let allows you to change the value stored in the variable

const always = "Be learning" //<-- const is short for constant, so it's value can not change. A note here: When you use const with an array or an object, you can add and remove things to the array and object because you're not changing the outer wrapper. It's kind of like you have a backpack. Even though the stuff you keep in the backpack changes, the backpack doesn't. 


// What can we keep in our variables? 

let booleanGoodDay = true;
let booleanBadDay = false;

const stringTypeWithDoubleQuotes = "get the cheese"
const stringTypeWithSingleQuotes = 'unwrap the cheese'
const stringTypeWithBackTicks = `eat the cheese` 

let numberInteger = 42 
let numberFloats = 3.14 //mmmmm... pie
