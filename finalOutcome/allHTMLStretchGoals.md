## Color

So far, we've only used color keywords (like 'blue', or 'red') to indicate the colors we want to use for styling. Find two other methods to show color and apply them to your webpage. Is there a way to change not only the color of an element, but also its transparency using one of these methods?  Change the background color of your webpage.

## CSS selectors

CSS selectors can get pretty involved - for example, you can style more than one element at a time by chaining selectors, or get super-specific (i.e. style the last child element of all <p> tags with a class of 'monkey'). Check out this lesson on Learn.co (https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/css-selectors) that delves a little deeper into CSS selectors.
